# AIRPLAY-win32-player-binary-Archive
`AIRPLAY`是一个诞生于2011年左右的音乐播放器，因为时间久远并且与Apple后来的AirPlay重名，导致现在已经难以搜索到相关的信息了。  
`AIRPLAY` is a music player that was born around 2011, which is now difficult to search for because of its age and renaming with Apple's later AirPlay.

这个播放器在内置了音频解码器的情况下仍然做到了非常小的体积，并且还拥有简洁现代的界面和交互，是一个设计非常优秀的播放器。  
It's a very well-designed player that manages to be very small despite having a built-in audio decoder, and also has a clean and modern interface and interactions.

我有幸保存了它的一些发行版本，现在将它们分享出来，放在Release中供大家下载使用。  
I was lucky enough to save some of its releases, and I'm now sharing them in Releases for you to download and use.

个人推荐使用的两个版本分别是`zion`和`20130401`，前者是2011年发布的一个版本，在我保存的这些版本中拥有者最小的体积，后者是2013年发布的最后一个版本。  
The two versions I recommend are `zion`, which was released in 2011 and is the smallest of the releases I have saved, and `20130401`, which is the last version released in 2013.
